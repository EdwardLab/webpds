# WEB Public Download Server
A file link sharing program using Python Flask, designed to handle large files with secure, time-limited download links. It prevents direct linking, abuse, and server overload by requiring users to request download links with valid expiration times.

# Introduction
This project is a file link sharing program built using Python Flask, designed to facilitate the secure and efficient sharing of large files. The program generates download links with a validity period based on the file size to prevent direct linking, abuse, and server overload.

Users must request a download link from the server, and each generated link includes an expiration time to ensure the file is accessible only for a limited period. This enhances security and effectively manages server load, ensuring that only authorized requests can download the files within the specified timeframe.
